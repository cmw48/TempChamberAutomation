Manual process:

COOL TO -20
1) start machine in COOL MODE
a) flip lever to cool.  compressor starts.

2) adjust set point to -20
a) flip and hold set point switch
  note- ONLY NEEDED FOR HUMAN INPUT
b) with set point pulled up, turn potentiometer CCW until needle touches -20 mark on white paper.
Remember- eggs generate their own heat.  If ref temp says -28, eggs report around -24. (need verification)
Also, setpoint on white paper may have needed adjustment.

Looks like when eggs are warmed up 39.10 in egg equates to about 38.1 in box

* unit begins cooling down
* egg temp drops below ambient
don't really even need to do anything until we hit -15 or so.
(does it hurt to listen?)
then turn on fine control monitoring
if eggTemp < -15 then let's start looking at DofD
if DofD is > 1.0 then "still cooling down".  Record the temp as the egg crosses 1.0

let's also start looking at time in here somewhere.
when DofD < 0.5, what's the temp?
once DofD < 0.3, we think that might be pretty close to stable

when heating, does it really work out that we are about 1 full degree from target when we cross DofD at 0.9?
think about "rate of change" and "value of change"
in 10 sec, we have a DofD of 0.4, but an overall jump of 0.2 degree

need to look at DofD of 0.3 as "still climbing, but much more slowly than before"
in the example, temp leveled off at 39.09 (6x), then drifted to 39.12 and hit a streak of 6x
maybe things stay at DofD around 0.2, and temp can slowly creep up
how long did things stay at 0.2?  How many tenths of a degree did we gain?



39.14 hit 7x
then, oscillation between a higher number and a lower number 39.15-39.17-39.15
the first time the value goes back down is significant
then a creep up as the unit continues to heat, or maybe things in the box are equalizing
mark the time on each 0.1 and on each 0.0
when we hit 0.1, we know we aren't going up much further
the first 0.0 means we are stable
mark the time, light a green light, start the "timer"

consider:
start = time.time()
print("hello")
end = time.time()
print(end - start)

we have about 5 sec per tick
about 12 ticks a minute
if we miss a reading or a group of readings, A) we want to know, and B_ we'd kind of like to extend the time about that long
so, missed ticks don't count towards "elapsed stable time"
two questions
(how long since the last reading?)
and
how many ticks have you counted since we were stable (and stayed stable!)?
if you hit 720 good readings/ticks, that's about an hour.
if we missed 20-50 ticks in there, we've got more than an hour which is still probably good.

once you hit 720, then do the time math
startWhenStable = time.time()
...keep on tickin'
endWhenWeHit720Ticks = time.time()
durationWhileStable = end-start
if durationWhileStable = more than 3600, then we are good

examing neg and pos-- -0.1 means temp is climbing, +0.1 means it's dropping
(across the 10 readings of 5 seconds each)

DofD is an averaged average?  over 50 seconds worth of data.

What is temp at 0.0  = 39.20
what is the alarm level (if temp drops below lower bound 39.1 or rises above upper bound 39.3?)
